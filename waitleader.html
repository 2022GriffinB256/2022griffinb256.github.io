<p>You wait for the leader. You see a man walking down with a holy light surrounding him. You ask him why you are here, and how you got here. He responds with "Young child, I shall tell you why you are here. It is because of one reason, and one reason alone. We are on a TV set, and this is a social experiment. Get pranked bro."  much god.</p>
